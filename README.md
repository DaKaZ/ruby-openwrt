# Ruby Event Machine packages for OpenWrt Barrier Breaker #

*OpenWrt is described as a Linux distribution for embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management.* [-  OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/)

There are over [2000 packages](http://downloads.openwrt.org/backfire/10.03.1/brcm63xx/packages/) available for OpenWrt. Here I provide a few Ruby packages, specifically for a **websocket server**.
